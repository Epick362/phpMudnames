mudnames, originaly written by Ragnar Hojland Espinosa, is a small daemon
which will listen for incoming telnet connections on port 4004. When a
connection is received, it will output a randomly generated list of sample
character names suitable for use on many Multi-User-Dungeon type games. 

Here, it's only the generator part.

I have added some .cap file to force capability of the dictionnary. Feel
free to explore all possibilities ;)
